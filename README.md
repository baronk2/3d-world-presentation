## Description
This makes a semi-3D world (with 2D sprites) that allows you to move around and watch an interactive presentation from a University of Washington Informatics course (Autumn 2022: INFO 498 - Special Topics in Informatics: Technology and Childhood - Theory, Research, & Practice).

I used this 3D world format with a Zoom Screenshare to present to the class.

## Examples

## Demo / Develop
There are a few different ways to run this Scratch code. It can be done offline or online. If you have a stable internet connection, the easiest way is to use Scratch's online editor.

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository and download the `.sb3` file(s) locally.

2. Open the `.sb3` file(s).

- Online:

    - a. [Get Started](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted) with a new project on Scratch.

    - b. In the upper left of the interface, choose "File > Load from your computer."

    - c. Select the file you wish to demo or develop, and choose "Open."

- Offline:

    - a. Please see Scratch's [Downloads Page](https://scratch.mit.edu/download) for instructions about how to download and use the Scratch App offline.

3. In the upper right corner of the interface, there is a runtime window that shows the background and sprites. Above this window there is a green flag. Press the green flag to start the script and run the app. Next to the green flag is a red stop sign. Press the red stop sign to stop all scripts. In the far upper right, there is an full-screen expand icon that looks like an X. Pressing the full-screen button will make the run-time window "full" screen (a little bit bigger).

4. Enjoy!

## Controls

### Movement
Move around relative to the direction you're facing using WASD keys. Move the mouse around to change the direction you're facing (about the y-axis, i.e. your own vertical axis, only).

### Presentation
- To start the presentation, move over toward the Random Octopus, the Dog, the Bird, and the opening slide.

- Click (shoot) the Random Octupus. This will start the presentation on a random slide that has a technology product and an evaluation prompt. (Note: starting the presentation by clicking the Dog or the Bird first will cause the slide counter to crash.)

- Click the Dog to change the product being evaluated to a random one of two other products.

- Click the Bird to change the evaluation prompt to a random one of 14 other prompts.

- Click the Random Octopus to change and randomize both the product and evaluation prompt.

- Have some fun! Note that the presentation will automatically face you no matter where you are in the 3D environment.
